# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
Clarity of Visualization- I changed the thickness of the lines in the Operational Challenges: Flight delays graph and made the lines thinner. This helps to clearly distinguish between the three different airlines represented by each of the colors.

Simplified Map- Another participant found the map too overwhelming, so I reduced some of the data points on the graph for better readability and highlighted the airports that were affected the most.

Shorthand Modification- I made some navigational changes in Shorthand for easier flow between the different sections to create a story.

Conclusion and References- Conclusion needed some improvements so I made a few tweaks to align it better to the story. Initially I had a few references, now I added multiple sources like Bureau of Transportation Statistics and Kaggle.


## The audience
For this project the target audience is the airlines industry professionals as well as policymakers who are focused on creating future resilient strategies in case such a crisis occurs again. I made a few visualizations simpler to understand, capturing all the aspects for both the experts as well as for the general audience as they have different backgrounds in this topic.


## Final design decisions
In terms of design my project topic first started with just focusing on the impact of the pandemic of businesses and its recovery but since that is too broad, I got more specific and selected the airlines industry. I love to travel, and I was curious to know how much COVID-19 affected this industry and travel changes after this major hit.

After creating multiple visualization for this topic, the feedbacks I received from part 2 really helped me understand where there is scope for improvement. My participants ranged from frequent travelers like me to the general audience. I started with a personal story to make my presentation relatable for others and that would make them interested to read further.

For my first visualization I created a plot that highlighted the impact on a daily basis but that seemed too cluttered, so I went with exploring the impact over time in months and years. This gave more clarity to see how it affected from a high level rather than just focusing on daily change. From this it is evident that there is a steep decline in the year 2020 from the previous years and this might not be so interpretable from the daily chart.

Finally, I incorporated all the feedback that I received from every phase every phase and all the in-class critique sessions like: <br>
 Adding better visual clarity for the trend line graph by reducing the thickness of the line. <br>
 Making all the colors consistent and also color-blind friendly. <br>
 Tying in a personal story to keep the narrative engaging for the audience. <br>
 Focusing on researching the actual story behind the airlines industry rather than all businesses. <br>
 Including time-series graphs to show the impact over time. <br>
 Keeping only the key data points on the graph and removing others to avoid any confusion for the readers. <br>


## References
All the references are cited in my Shorthand. I have ensured to credit all the datasets and visuals and double-checked that I have not used any copyright material.


# Final thoughts
Reflecting on the entire process, I am really happy how the visualizations and the narrative seem to flow telling a very compelling story. All the feedback and the critiques helped a lot in building my narrative and adding clarity. It helped me get the ideas and views of the general audience as well as those who were severely affected by it. Initially it was a little tricky to get all the right datasets as I only had Kaggle as my source, eventually I found more trustable data sets from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Both these data sources were useful as I not only built my story on how it impacted the industry but also gave a big picture of its recovery and the influence of delays due to the strict lockdowns and travel bans. If I had more time, I would have added a detailed case study on a few major airlines which would personalize the story more. Overall, I am excited by how much I have learnt from this class project to form a compelling narrative by the last phase of the project, and I believe this will resonate well with my target audience to give them more insights and call to action.
