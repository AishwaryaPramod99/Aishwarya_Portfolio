# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
Clarity in Visualization - I have changed the thickness of they Operational Challenges: Flight delays graph and made the lines thinner. This helps to clearly distinguish between the three different airlines represented by each of the colors.

Simplified Map - Another participant had found the map too overwhelming so I reduced some of the data points on the graph for better readability and highlighted the airports that were affected the most.

Shorthand Modification - I made some navigational changes in shorthand for easier flow between the different sections to create a story.

Conclusion and References - Conclusion needed some improvements so I made a few tweaks to align it better to the story. Initially I had a few references, now I added multiple sources like Bureau of Transportation Statistics and Kaggle.

## The audience
For this project the target audience is the airlines industry professionals as well as policymakers whose focused on creating future resilient strategies in case such crisis occurs again. I made the few visualization more simpler to understand, yet capturing all the aspects for both the experts as well as for the general audience as they have different backgrounds on this topic.


## Final design decisions
In terms of design my project topic first started with just focusing on the impact of the pandemic of business and its recovery but since that is too broad, I got more specific and selected the airlines industry. I love to travel and I was curious to know how COVID-19 affected this industry and travel changes after this major hit. 

After creating multiple visualization for this topic the feeedbacks from part 2 really helped me understand where there is scope for improvement. My paricipants ranged from frequent travelers like me to the general audience. I started with a personal story to make my presentation relatable for others and that would keep them to read further. 

For my first visualization I created a plot that highlighted the impact on a daily basis but that seemed to cluttered so I went with exploring the impact over time in months and years. This gave more clarity as to see how it affected from a high level rather than daily change. From this it was evident that there was a steep decline in 2020 from the previous years and this might not be so interpretable from the daily chart.

Finally I incorporated all the feedbacks that I received from every phase every phase and all the in-class critique sessions like:<br>
 Adding better visual clarity for the trend line graph by reducing the thickness of the line. <br>
 Making all the colors consistent and also color-blind friendly. <br>
 Tying in a personal story to keep the narrative engaging for the audience. <br>
 Focusing on a researching the actual story behind the airlines industry rather than all businesses. <br>
 Including time-series graphs to show the impact over time. <br>
 Keeping only the data points on the graph and removing the other to avoid any confusion for the readers. <br>

# Final thoughts
Reflecting on the entire process I am really happy how the visualizations and the narrative seem to flow telling a very compelling story. All the feedbacks and the critiques helped a lot in building my story and adding clarity. It helped me get the ideas and views of the general audience as well as those who were severly affected by it. Initially it was a little tricky to get all the right datasets as I only had Kaggle as my source, eventually I found more trustable data sets from the Bureau of Transportation. Both these datasources were helpful as I could not only build my story on how it impacted the indutry but also gave a big picture of its recovery and the incluence of delays due to the pandamic. If I had more time I would have added a detailed case studies on a few major airlines which would personalize the story more. Overall I excited by jow much I have learnt from this class project to form a narrative by last phase of the project and I believe the project will resonate well with my target audience to give them more insights and call to action.
