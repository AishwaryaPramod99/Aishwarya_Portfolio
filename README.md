# About me
Hello! I’m Aishwarya (she/her), a passionate data science enthusiast currently pursuing a Master of Information Systems Management with a concentration in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (MISM-BIDA) at Carnegie Mellon University. I have a strong academic background in data science, having specialized in this field during my undergraduate studies at PES University and now deepening my expertise through my graduate program.

Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and data-driven decision-making. I’m particularly excited about applying machine learning techniques to real-world challenges and am constantly seeking opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects that can make a meaningful impact. I believe in the power of data to tell compelling stories and drive strategic initiatives, and I am eager to continue building my skills in this dynamic field.

# What I hope to learn
In this course, I hope to deepen my understanding of how to effectively tell stories with data. I am particularly interested in:

    Learning best practices for designing data visualizations, including color theory, layout, and choice of visualization.
    Developing skills in critiquing data visualizations and providing constructive feedback.
    Exploring various tools and techniques for creating both static and interactive visualizations.
    Understanding how to conduct user research to ensure that my visualizations are effectively communicating the intended message.
    Gaining hands-on experience in creating a publicly accessible portfolio of my work.

After completing this course, I plan to apply these skills to future projects and in my professional career, where I aim to use data storytelling to support evidence-based decision-making.

# Projects

1. Stock Market Prediction -
Developed a predictive model to forecast stock prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and implementing algorithms like ARIMA and LSTM for time series prediction.

2. Hate Speech Detection - Conducted a project to detect hate speech on Twitter using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project involved collecting Twitter data, preprocessing text, and applying machine learning models to classify tweets as hate speech or not. Visualizations were used to analyze the distribution of hate speech across different demographics and to illustrate the model’s performance metrics, enhancing the understanding of the findings.
