# Outline 

The Covid-19 attack affected world economies a great deal as many establishments remained closed, there were drops in revenue, and operations were disrupted. The essence of my project is to look at specific sectors which include big and small scale businesses, and how they were impacted during the Covid-19 pandemic economic crisis and how they recovered. Through this project my goal is to demonstrate how these businesses have coped through digital transformation, governmental assistance, and the use of information. This project will then compare the data collected from the earliest outbreak of COVID-19 to the current one in order to achieve a full recovery and depict the COVID-19 effects on business in the long run.

Through this project I propose to illustrate how different sectors of the economy were affected by the pandemic and how later economic resilience strategies were built. In my visual displays, I will show trends in revenue, recovery, and the impact of the economy on business to highlight how all aspects of data aided business recovery.

## Project Structure

In order to thoroughly examine the effects faced, the project will be divided into a number of important sections, oriented towards different parts of the business journey during the pandemic. 

1. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a lot of downfalls to all the businesses globally such as travel, retails and local businesses which led to them facing unexpected economic shocks. Lockdowns and social distancing protocols resulted in sudden drop in revenue and major layoffs. Here my aim is to depict the key events that created a huge impact which forced all these businesses to adapt to the gradual changes.

2. The Downturn for Businesses: <br>
Businesses had to immediately close down, their sales plummeted and they also faced a lot of obstacles which affected them to operate efficiently. Retailers had no customers, airlines had no passengers and small businesses too faced a lot of financial crises. Here, my plan is to add visualizations demonstrating year-over-year comparisons for sales and employment will show just how significantly these sectors were impacted.

3. Adapting to the Change: <br>
While the pandemic continued, businesses tried their best to survive this situation. A lot of alternative solutions came up, especially a lot of digital transformations like online ordering increased, work from home and meeting customer needs through contactless services also became really common. The government launched a lot of support programs to help and provid financial aid for those who were suffering significantly. For this section I plan to add visual comparisons of pre-pandemic and post-pandemic revenue trends to illustrate how businesses found new ways to generate income. 

4. Strategic Shifts in Business Operations: <br>
To overcome this and move on, businesses tried to come up with other ways to improve and make profits. For instance, retail stores started to invest a lot in delivering their products to the customers, airlines introduced safety protocols and restaurants too mostly focused on delivery to maintain their operations. Adding visuals like infographics and sector specific recovery maps will demonstrate how different businesses flourished.

5. Conclusion: <br>
Reflecting across the journey from crises to recovery, it is clear the importance of digital technology and innovation to overcoming the obstacles met during the pandemic. This did cause issues for many who had their businesses at small and large scales. But some of them which utilized the new technologies and quickly adapted to the change were better positioned to navigate their way. The lesson learned from here is that the world is very unpredictable, and it is important to be prepared for any future disruptions.

The target audience for this project are businessmen, entrepreneurs, investors and market analysts who seek to understand and find a solution to overcome these challenges and find a solution to rise back up in the market. They draw insights from adopting these strategies like learning how digital transformation works and exploring multiple business recovery processes which are critical for these audiences as the insights gained from this analysis can guide future business strategies. This will be helpful for them to be better prepared when such crisis occurs in the future.

# The Data
I have listed the datasets available on Kaggle which I will be using to show how businesses were impacted by COVID-19 and also to highlight their recovery with time.

Below is the link to the data sources: <br>

# Method and Medium
Method: The proposed project will use multiple elements of data visualization in Tableau to explore and communicate various insights of pandemic's impact on businesses and their recovery paths. The data will be visualized to develop engaging and interactive visuals to effectively communicate the story to the audience. Tableau provides the ability to create dashboards which are dynamic in nature, giving the audience an opportunity to see the data trends guests in a real-world style setting to enhance accessibility for data analysis. I beleive this tool is an ideal approach for visualizing business impacts and patterns of recovery and would provide the audience to facilitate active engagement with data observation.

Medium: For the final project I will embed these visualizations into Shorthand, an online storytelling platform that merges text and visuals. I will be using Tableau along with Shorthand to develop an engaging and visually stunning storytelling narrative along with data visualizations providing an interactive experience that will highlight the impact during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. It will help to connect the business journey from a crisis to recovery state.
