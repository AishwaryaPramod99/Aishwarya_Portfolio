# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

This project will focus on providing an understanding of how senton, public feeling, and response to the various things posted on the social platforms differ with the regions of the world, and how the change with time. Many are now making use of Instagram, Facebook and Twitter and these have so much data from humans which includes engagement metrics such as likes and comments. Many events get a trending and viral turn and here our goal is to map each of these sentiments to each of the engagements. 

The primary goal, therefore, is to monitor the trends and sentiments in the different social media streams. In analyzing various types of content created by the users, it would be easy to understand how emotions progress, understanding the change of sentiments from one region to another and figuring out the cause of such change. This project will also look at the trends between types of sentiment with engagement. The study will determine which emotion has higher tendencies of forging an attachment with the different platforms and their users.

Importance 
Opinions from these social media platforms are important towards determining the opinion of the public. This information is especially beneficial for businesses, investors, the government and others who may be looking forward to knowing how specific individuals feel in relation to some topic. This will not only give a trend of sentiment, but also the kind of knowledge that can be used to influence public feeling. 
Problem Statement:
Explore how people’s feelings and reactions on social media vary across regions and change over time, uncovering trends and the factors that drive public engagement.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

This dataset here is  “Social Media Sentiments Analysis Dataset” that is available on Kaggle. It consists of posts from social media public forums like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook as well as tweets and posts that contain associated data such as time stamps, user parameters, type of platform, hashtags, region, and engagement levels, likes, comments, retweets. The dataset is labeled with sentiment categories: that gives information regarding positive, negative, and neutral tweets making it easier to determine the overall public opinion on different topics. The key purpose of applying this dataset is to find out how the public mood shifts or is different at another period or geographical area. This way, the project will show the correlation between different sentiments and engagement metrics as well as uncover any patterns.

# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.
Method: The proposed project will use principles and design elements of data visualization to explore and communicate patterns of public sentiment explored across different platforms of social media. Key tools for public sentiment for engagement indicators such as likes, comments, and shares will be mapped out to develop an understanding of regional and geographic variation. The data will be visualized to develop an engaging narrative full of valuable insights from the data for an audience.

Medium: The final project will integrate a combination of a data visualization platform called Tableau and an online storytelling platform called Shorthand. Tableau will be utilized to develop interactive with data visualizations and dashboards representing sentiment trends, reactions and dynamics during the phase of a particular event. Shorthand will be used to develop an engaging and visually stunning storytelling narrative along with Tableau data visualizations providing a seamless and interactive storytelling experience. The final project will be hosted on an Github webpage to allow the audience to interact with the data and insights.
