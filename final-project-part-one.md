# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

This dataset here is  “Social Media Sentiments Analysis Dataset” that is available on Kaggle. It consists of posts from social media public forums like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook as well as tweets and posts that contain associated data such as time stamps, user parameters, type of platform, hashtags, region, and engagement levels, likes, comments, retweets. The dataset is labeled with sentiment categories: that gives information regarding positive, negative, and neutral tweets making it easier to determine the overall public opinion on different topics. The key purpose of applying this dataset is to find out how the public mood shifts or is different at another period or geographical area. This way, the project will show the correlation between different sentiments and engagement metrics as well as uncover any patterns.

Description: A dataset containing social media posts with sentiment labels and engagement metrics. <br>


# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.
Method: The proposed project will use principles and design elements of data visualization to explore and communicate patterns of public sentiment explored across different platforms of social media. Key tools for public sentiment for engagement indicators such as likes, comments, and shares will be mapped out to develop an understanding of regional and geographic variation. The data will be visualized to develop an engaging narrative full of valuable insights from the data for an audience.

Medium: The final project will integrate a combination of a data visualization platform called Tableau and an online storytelling platform called Shorthand. Tableau will be utilized to develop interactive with data visualizations and dashboards representing sentiment trends, reactions and dynamics during the phase of a particular event. Shorthand will be used to develop an engaging and visually stunning storytelling narrative along with Tableau data visualizations providing a seamless and interactive storytelling experience. The final project will be hosted on an Github webpage to allow the audience to interact with the data and insights.
