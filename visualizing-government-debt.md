# Visualizing Government Debt

## Part one: Working with web-based visualization tools and data

Government Debt as a Percentage of GDP - 2023

For this part of the assignment, I used OECD data to visualize general government debt as a percentage of GDP for various countries in 2023. Here bar chart provides a clear and straightforward way to compare debt levels across nations.

The chart shows that Greece and the United States have significantly higher debt levels relative to their GDP compared to other countries. It also highlights nations with lower debt levels, such as Estonia and the OECD average, offering a comprehensive overview of global debt variation.

By visualizing the data this way, it becomes easy to identify which countries are struggling with high debt and which have managed to keep their debt levels low. This visualization is especially useful for policymakers, economists, and researchers who need to quickly understand the global debt landscape and identify countries that may require closer economic attention.

## Part two: Working with Tableau

In this section, I used Tableau to visualize government debt data over time, focusing on the debt-to-GDP ratio across different countries from 1995 to 2019. The heatmap I created makes it easy to compare trends in debt levels, with the color gradients indicating changes in debt values over time. This visualization effectively shows how government debt evolved in each country and highlights countries with particularly high or low levels of debt during specific periods.

Here is the embedded Tableau dashboard

## Part three: Create your own visualization

The line graph effectively shows how debt-to-GDP ratios for the top 10 countries have changed over time. Unlike bar charts or heat maps, it highlights long-term trends, such as Greece's debt crisis and Japan's steady increase. This visualization makes it easy to compare countries and see how debt levels have evolved from 1998 to 2020.
