# Visualizing Government Debt

## Part One: Working with Web-Based Visualization Tools and Data

For this exercise, I began by exploring the OECDâ€™s government debt dataset. The dataset provides general government debt-to-GDP ratios across various countries from 1995 to 2021. Using the built-in web tool on the OECD website, I customized a bar chart to focus on the year 2021, where I could compare the debt-to-GDP ratios across countries. Below is the embedded visualization.

## Part Two: Working with Tableau

Next, I moved the dataset to Tableau for further analysis. After connecting the data and formatting the Time column correctly as a Date, I built a **highlight table** that allowed me to visually compare debt-to-GDP ratios across different countries over time.

I then adjusted the color palette and filtered out certain countries for a more focused analysis. The heatmap visualization helped highlight countries with extremely high debt-to-GDP ratios (above 100%) in a distinctive color, making the data easier to interpret. Below is the embedded heatmap visualization:
