<h1>Visualizing Government Debt</h1>

<h2>Part One: Working with Web-Based Visualization Tools and Data</h2>

<p>For this exercise, I began by exploring the OECDâ€™s government debt dataset. The dataset provides general government debt-to-GDP ratios across various countries from 1995 to 2021. Using the built-in web tool on the OECD website, I customized a bar chart to focus on the year 2021, allowing for comparison of debt-to-GDP ratios across different countries.</p>

<h2>Part Two: Working with Tableau</h2>

<p>Next, I imported the dataset into Tableau for further analysis. After connecting the data and correctly formatting the Time column as a date, I created a highlight table to visually compare debt-to-GDP ratios across various countries over time.</p>

<p>I customized the color palette to emphasize countries with high debt-to-GDP ratios (over 100%), and filtered out specific countries for better focus. This heatmap allowed me to more easily spot countries with critical debt situations. Below is the embedded heatmap visualization from Tableau:</p>

<h2>Part Three: Creating a New Visualization</h2>

<p>For the final part of this assignment, I created a line chart in Tableau, focusing on the changes in debt-to-GDP ratios over time for a few selected countries. This chart provides a dynamic view of how the debt ratios have evolved for these countries and highlights any significant changes over time.</p>
