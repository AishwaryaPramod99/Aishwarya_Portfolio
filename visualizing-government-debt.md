# Visualizing Government Debt

## Part One: Working with Web-Based Visualization Tools and Data

For this exercise, I began by exploring the **OECDâ€™s government debt dataset**. The dataset provides general government debt-to-GDP ratios across various countries from **1995 to 2021**. Using the built-in web tool on the OECD website, I customized a **bar chart** to focus on the year **2021**, allowing for comparison of debt-to-GDP ratios across different countries.

## Part Two: Working with Tableau

Next, I imported the dataset into **Tableau** for further analysis. After connecting the data and correctly formatting the **Time** column as a date, I created a **highlight table** to visually compare debt-to-GDP ratios across various countries over time.

I customized the **color palette** to emphasize countries with high debt-to-GDP ratios (over 100%), and filtered out specific countries for better focus. This heatmap allowed me to more easily spot countries with critical debt situations. Below is the embedded heatmap visualization from Tableau:

## Part Three: Creating a New Visualization

For the final part of this assignment, I created a **line chart** in Tableau, focusing on the changes in debt-to-GDP ratios over time for a few selected countries. This chart provides a dynamic view of how the debt ratios have evolved for these countries and highlights any significant changes over time.

This chart was chosen to give a better understanding of how the debt-to-GDP ratios have trended over time, showing increases and decreases in various countries. Below is the embedded line chart visualization:
