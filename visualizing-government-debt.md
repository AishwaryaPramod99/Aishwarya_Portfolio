# Title
Visualizing Government Debt

## Part one: Working with web-based visualization tools and data

For this part of the assignment, I used OECD data to visualize general government debt as a percentage of GDP in 2023. I chose to create a bar chart, which effectively represents the debt levels of various countries, allowing for easy comparison across nations.

The visualization shows the percentage of GDP attributed to government debt for each country, with Greece and the United States showing significantly higher debt levels compared to other countries. The chart also includes countries with lower debt levels, such as Estonia and the OECD average country, providing a comprehensive overview of how government debt varies across different regions.

By visualizing the data in this way, it is easy to see which countries are struggling with high debt relative to their GDP and which countries have managed to maintain lower debt levels. This type of visualization is useful for policymakers, economists, and researchers who want to quickly understand the global debt landscape.

## Part 2: Working with Tableau

_A reminder that to get the Tableau visualization to render correctly on Github, you'll have to do a bit of editing of the code block once you paste it here. As before, make sure to walk us through what you did in Tableau, and any thoughts or observations, etc._

## Part three: Create your own visualization

_Create another data visualization using the same data used earlier. DO NOT submit something that's just a minor modification of one of the visualizations already covered here. So, don't just modify the colors or labels of one of the earlier examples and call it good, or submit a slightly modified bar chart. Instead, see what you can come up with on your own, and spend some time to try and create something that tells a story about the data._

_Summarize in a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare/contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well. Talk about why you chose the third data visualization. Be specific - keep your writeup relevant to the assignment, and avoid jargon-filled language that doesn't say anything useful._

_It's a good idea to go back and review your work. Could someone follow your process and understand what you did? Do you need to further connect any of the sections with a bit of text? Is it something you'd be happy to have as an example of your work from the class?_
